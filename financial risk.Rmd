## In certain risk management scenarios, it may be satisfactory to analyze equity risk through 
## index modeling. However, for a more granular understanding of risk within a portfolio of 
## stocks, one can delve deeper into the specific prices of individual shares.

# Load S&P 500 constituents data
data("SP500_const")

# Extract AMZN and BAC in 2007-2010
stocks <- SP500_const['2007/2010', c('AMZN','BAC')]

## In the case of a portfolio that is exposed to risk across various countries, it is 
## essential to take into account the potential risks stemming from foreign exchange (FX) rates.

# Load exchange rate data

# Plot the exchange rates in fx0710

## In the process of risk analysis, a critical objective is to model the variations in prices 
## and rates across various time periods, which are commonly referred to as returns.
