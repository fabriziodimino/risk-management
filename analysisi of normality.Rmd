# Load SP500 index
data('SP500')
head(SP500)
tail(SP500)

# Extract 2007-2010
sp07_10 <- SP500['2007/2010']

# Compute the log-returns of sp07_10 daily and monthly
sp07_10_x <- na.omit(diff(log(sp07_10)))
sp07_10_x_m <- apply.monthly(sp07_10_x, sum)

# Calculate average and standard deviation
mu <- mean(sp07_10_x)
sigma <- sd(sp07_10_x)

# Plot histogram
hist(sp07_10_x, nclass = 20, probability = TRUE, main = "Histogram with Normal Density")

# # dnorm(x, mean, sd) calculates the probability density function (PDF) of the data x with the calculated sample mean and standard deviation; this is known as the method-of-moments.
# Add the normal density as a red line to histogram
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# To calculate an estimate of the density of data x, use density(x). This creates a so-called kernel-density estimate (KDE) using a non-parametric method that makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution.
# Plot non-parametric KDE
plot(density(sp07_10_x))

# Add the normal density as a red line to KDE
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# The various plots suggest that the data are heavier tailed than normal


## The quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) is a better graphical method for revealing non-normality.
qqnorm(sp07_10_x)
qqline(sp07_10_x, col = "red")

## Now, we compare the plot with simulated datasets from normal, Student t and uniform distributions
n <- length(sp07_10_x)

# Generate n standard normal variables, make a Q-Q plot, add a red line
x1 <- rnorm(n)
qqnorm(x1)
qqline(x1, col = "red")

# Generate n Student t variables, make a Q-Q plot, add a red line
x2 <- rt(n, df = 4)
qqnorm(x2)
qqline(x2, col = "red")

# Generate n standard uniform variables, make a Q-Q plot, add red line
x3 <- runif(n)
qqnorm(x3)
qqline(x3, col = "red")

## Tests of Normality
skewness(sp07_10_x)
kurtosis(sp07_10_x)
jarque.test(as.vector(sp07_10_x))

# If skewness is close to zero, it indicates that the distribution is approximately symmetric. A negative value suggests a heavier tail on the left (left-skewed distribution).

# A higher kurtosis value indicates heavier tails and higher peaks compared to a normal distribution.

# The Jarque-Bera test has a very low p-value (p-value < 2.2e-16), indicating that you can reject the null hypothesis that the data follows a normal distribution.

# Testing normality for longer time horizons
# As returns are added together over longer time periods, a central limit effect takes place and returns tend to become more normal.
